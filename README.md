1. I have used linked list to store the name and details like registration no address and blood group and age also I am dynamically storing this data in data file “patient” so that the data does not get lost when the program runs the data from data file is stored back in the file in the form of linked list
2. I have used stack for storing the logs of each individual person because in real life also logs are taken in LIFO order  here also I am storing the data dynamically in data file ”name” and taking it back and pushing to the stack when the programing is running(1 persons log=1 stack+1 data file)
3. I have used linear searching of a linked list to take the record of his details by making the user enter his name
4. I have used class and object for linked list and stack
